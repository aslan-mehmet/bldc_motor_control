clock configuration test

apb1 low speed bus 42M, also called pclk1
apb2 fast speed bus 84M, pclk2
ahb 168M, hclk

systick set, period 1m
one timer set each periph bus, 1m

led_green, systick, each 100m after toggle, pd12
led_blue, tim1, pclk2, 1m, pd15
led_red, tim2, pclk1, 1m, pd14

*************************************************
results

after apb prescaler, another multiplier exist for timers
tim1 and tim2 freq = relavent bus * 2

{SYSCLK_Frequency = 168000000, HCLK_Frequency = 168000000, 
  PCLK1_Frequency = 42000000, PCLK2_Frequency = 84000000}

**************************************************

after adding prescaler for hclk, pclk1, pclk2

{SYSCLK_Frequency = 168000000, HCLK_Frequency = 168000000, 
  PCLK1_Frequency = 42000000, PCLK2_Frequency = 84000000}
